# Learning C++

This repository tracks my journey as I learn the fundamentals of **C++**, as preparation for building a **chess engine and robotics systems**.

### 📌 Topics I plan to work through:

- Variables & Data Types  
- Loops & Control Flow  
- Functions  
- Pointers  
- Arrays & Strings  
- Classes & OOP  
- Memory Management  
- File Handling

This repo will grow as I practice and upload code examples or notes.
